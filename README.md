# Merkle-Hellman-Knapsack-Cryptosystem

This project was a part of the first among the 5 unique projects of the '95-771 - Data Structure and Algorithms for Information Processing' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Prof. Mike McCarthy, a renowned genius mind in this field, taught the course. 

- Implemented a Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem in Java using IntelliJ IDE

- Developed a singly linked list class to hold two lists of Java BigIntegers for private and public keys

- Used powers of 7 to generate superincreasing sequence of integers for the private key

- Encapsulated all list-related operations in the linked list class and implemented key generation, encryption and decryption
